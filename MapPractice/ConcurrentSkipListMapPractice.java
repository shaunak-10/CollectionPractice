        ConcurrentSkipListMap is a special implementation of the Map interface that provides a scalable and concurrent implementation of a skip list data structure.
        Skip lists are a type of data structure that allows for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations.
        ConcurrentSkipListMap is similar to TreeMap, but it is designed to be thread-safe and allows multiple threads to access the map concurrently.
        ConcurrentSkipListMap achieves this by using a lock-free algorithm that allows multiple threads to access the map without blocking each other.
